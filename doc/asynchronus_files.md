# Asynchronous files manager (Drive)


## Usage

 Files are to big to be send inside HTTP request, so we created Drive. Drive is a REST API you want to use for sending files.  
 You need to register to the API, then you can send as musch files as you want to an app. You will be notified if a file  
 is sent to you and where to get the file.
