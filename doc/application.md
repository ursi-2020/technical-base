# Application

## Creating a new application:

By default your git repository is empty, fortunately we provide you with a demo application to present the different features you would be able to use in your final 
application.


## Adding a new app on the VM:

Once VM ssh connection is etablished:
- Launch the command:
```
application_helper -a
```
- Enter the name of your application.
- Do not forgot id of the created database that will be displayed by the script:
![app](./images/add_app.png)

- The code of the application exemple has been cloned in your shared folder and is therefore accessible (from your host machine and therefore from your favorite IDE).
- You can git push this white application on your repository.
